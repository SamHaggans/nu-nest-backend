## NUNEST
Our team came up with the idea of NuNest to address unique subletting needs of students at Northeastern University.

Northeastern students' schedules can include learning on-campus, learning remotely, working on co-op, and studying abroad - impacting subletting needs among students living off campus. Northeastern students often need temporary housing for just a spring, summer 1, summer 2, or fall semester. Since most leases in the Boston area are year-long, there are a large number of students with leases looking for someone to sublet their apartment for terms they will be away and an equally large number of students looking to sublet a space while they plan to live in Boston rather than signing a year-long lease.

Most students currently need to post in online communities like Facebook and Reddit to find roommates and/or subletters; these systems host an abundance of other content which can be difficult to search and filter through to find relevant posts. NU Nest will create a centralized, easy-to-use network of ‘subleters’ and ‘subletees’ with an emphasis on increasing visibility and access to housing connections through the Northeastern community. This product targets a more niche demographic than existing apps and platforms typically used for browsing rentals in Boston.

Users offering sublet or roommate openings on NU Nest will be able to create postings of their apartments and specify attributes like size, location, and cost. Users who are looking to browse housing options will be able to filter and search specific attributes they are looking for and signal interest to connect with offerors. Users will also have the option to search for roommates (off-campus housing only) if they have a housing option in mind but need one or more people. Our platform will not offer lease/legal support – our focal point is creating a platform for users to make connections and hope they will be able to work out logistical details on their own. Moderators will review flagged posts and flagged users for inappropriate content and can edit listings if needed. This new application will enhance the process of connecting students with compatible housing needs around Northeastern University’s Boston campus.
